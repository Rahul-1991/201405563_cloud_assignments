In this program i have tried to use the mininet terminal to virtually create N switches and assign 2 hosts to each of the switches.
Half of the hosts are assigned to 10.0.0.x ip and the other half are assigned to 11.0.0.x ip.
Each of the switch is connected to one host from 10.0.0.x pool and one from 11.0.0.x pool.
All the switches are connected to the one after it in liner order.
